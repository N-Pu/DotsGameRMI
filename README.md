# Dots Game on console (with RMI)

It's a "Dots" game where you draw lines betwin dots and get maximum score. 
There can be 2 players in. So let's start.

# <How does it work?>

1. First of all you have to start Server.java file.
2. Next up is Client.java and SecondClient.java to get access with player 1 and 2.

3. Then you see this:
